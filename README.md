# Crop-Recommendation-Dataset

## Abstract
Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. Here, I present you a dataset which would allow the users to build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.

## Context
This dataset was build by augmenting datasets of rainfall, climate and fertilizer data available for India.

## Data fields

N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil
K - ratio of Potassium content in soil
temperature - temperature in degree Celsius
humidity - relative humidity in %
ph - ph value of the soil
rainfall - rainfall in mm

## Model Building Steps

Step 1: Importing Data Manipulation Liabraries

Step 2: Loading dataset using Pandas function

Step 3: Model Preprocessing : Including Feature Engineering

Step 4: Split the Dataset into Train and Test[ Ensuring Data Leackage Not There]

Step 5: Model Building

Step 6: Save Pickel File
